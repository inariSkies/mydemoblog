**ABOUT THE PROJECT**
This was my first time using django, github, and my first large python project
Objectives were to:
-create a blog
-view a list of posts as the home page 
-view of each post in detail
-create a post  
-edit a post
-persist post using a database 

I struggled with getting information from the textarea's to persist into the database, however I was able to get it working
The logic inside of the views publish function is not the prettiest, but it gets the job done.
I've commented in it for clarity
The largest time consumer for me was just learning how to use Django and incorporate all the different pieces together.
It may not be the prettiest style, but I am proud of the overall outcome.
